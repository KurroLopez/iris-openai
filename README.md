# Bg-openai
Banksia Global's take on OpenAI IRIS Interoperability Business Operation based on great work by Kurro Lopez at https://github.com/KurroLopez/iris-openai

The main difference is in class naming conventions, aligning them better to IRIS standard.

## The idea
You will get a single business operation Banksia.OpenAi.Operation which supports all API calls by OpenAI API: chat, images, audio etc

## Prerequisites
You will need OpenAI API key and a little balance on your OpenAI account to test this operation. See details here https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=curl

## Installation 

- Install using ZPM 

```
zpm "install bg-openai"
```

Alternatively just load "src/Banksia" folder into your IRIS instance.

## How to use it
